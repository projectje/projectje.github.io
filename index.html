<h2></h2>2019-09-15</h2>
<p>
    Was on my todo list but today added a  page (<a href="https://pages.github.com/"> pages </a></a>)
    Instead of using a tool like <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> I think I will create something in PowerShell that will
    generate my static pages. Undoubtly someone has already made this but its probably only a few hours work (...) to do so.
    I think there will be something like posts. When I started blogging the concept of a headline did not exist, i think I will revert
    to this, since headlines became SEO and is way to pretentious. It will need some taxonomy (tags,categories, projects), a search system,
    a comment system, a way to store media, a way to handle links outdated, special sections for specific topics, etc... so in the end
    it might be more than a few hours work.
</p>
<p>
    Probably there are little pieces of content which have a type e.g. a post, page, bookmarks and so on, each of these have properties
    and the properties can be complex and custom. Each of these pieces of content can have a specific workflow attached, which is code.
    So I think each of these pieces of content is an object based on a class. So probably there needs to be folder class definitions first.
    Classes have their own taxonomy.<br />
    To import tens of thousands of wordpress posting (and before wordpress from the end 90's). Its probably handy to include the properties
    that WordPress exports in its backup XML file, so that a mass conversion is the easiest this will be:
    <ul>
        <li>item
            <ul>
                <li>title</li>
                <li>link</li>
                <li>pubDate</li>
                <li>dc:creator</li>
                <li>guid with indication if permalink</li>
                <li>description</li>
                <li>content:encoded which is a CDATA item</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>this contains relative and fixed paths so a conversion needs to run here</li>
                    <li>it would also be nice if a linkchecker removes any links that are outdated</li>
                    <li>some spellchecker would be very nice...</li>
                </ul>
                <li>expert: idem also encoded Cdata, in my case mostly empty</li>
                <li>wp:post_id might be handy to keep as reference</li>
                <li>wp:post_date might be handy to keep as reference</li>
                <li>wp:post_date_gmt idem</li>
                <li>wp:comment_status idem</li>
                <li>wp:ping_status idem but never used it</li>
                <li>wp:status idem</li>
                <li>wp:post_parent</li>
                <li>wp:menu_order</li>
                <li>wp:post_type</li>
                <li>wp_post_password probably useless in new system</li>
                <li>wp:is_sticky probably handy to convert to equal functionality</li>
                <li>category domain niceame cdata : will convert these but keep the old ones around for reference</li>
                <li>wp:postmeta consisting of wp:meta_key and wp_meta_value (CDATA) will convert these but keep old ones around for reference</li>

            </ul>
        </li>
        I think I have roughly 20.000 individual postings since 99, problem is that I sometimes posted things I dont agree with anymore, and also
        it contains a gazillion links that no longer exists or where there are now different sites. So I might in the end need to check them one by ones
        and add some annotation OR put some annotation above like "not re-reviewed yet disclaimer" or something alike.
        Also since I have multiple backups of different blogs, might need to find a mechanism to filter out duplicate entries, since I did some conversions
        in between, might not be 1:1.
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    So to do this incremental the simplest way to start is probably to have a sidebar with each individual blog entry. That can later be replaced by
    tags, categories, aggregated blog overviews etc. "Styling" is something that go on endless so dont care about this. What is maybe important is the
    translation or indication if items are in Dutch or in English. Have to think about this but it might be a label OR very pretentious holds a master item
    with links to various translations. that would require a subdir for each post e.g. NL_nl for dutch and only in there the content, title and such while
    other meta properties reside one level higher. But that is too labor intensive.
</p>
<p>
    There is always the tradeoff between types and taxonomy. You can either make something a "post" or you just make everything content and via a taxonomy
    you add a property "post". Maybe it is the simplest to not implement any typing at all. Maybe first lookup articles who have done research on the tradeoff
    between types and taxonomy. I think... there are only things. Things get properties that are the same as other things. At a certain moment we can classify
    things with the same or mostly the same things in a taxonomy. Then we have a type on a metalevel. To that type we can then assign more things like custom
    workflows. So maybe I will not type things but rather let something scan through all content and create its own conclusions. Obviously when you have to
    create a new post it is most handy to see already the properties of a post so you can fill them in and it is also handy that there is a button submit
    so it is posted. Maybe copy based on existing item is then the handiest. So I could have 5000 postings with a "tag", and then i make 200 postings with a "tag",
    the system will then classify the ones with tag as a child-type of the non-tag type posting. Once this has been done, we can give names to the types
    it found and link in some other meta stuff for that type it found. Since now there are real physical copies of such a type versus beforehand creating
    these types. A taxonomy on the other hand is based on each individual property, so if a set of things have "tag" as property then a taxonomy auto exists.
    Since there are parent-child relationships, each property can have a parent.
    Individual properties are also things. When they are the same they form a type and a taxonomy. They also can have parent-child relationships.
    Properties can have attributes. These attributes are also things. More or less the same story.
    So a thing post holds a thing title which holds a thing language. The thing language holds only content and no further properties. So we can
    make a list of all entries for language in our system which in my case is only NL_nl and En_en. The thing title sometimes holds the property
    language and sometimes not. But since the type-hint is called "title" and it contains content, the system knows that we have a type language
    that sometimes holds these properties and sometimes not. The parser will need to have input on show title where language=Nl_nl. But the result of this
    is also a thing. So for the resulting blogpost it goes the same: we should give some example of the result and the system would then need
    to fiddle out the type of thing we want to produce. <br />
    The folder structure on disk is only allowing for one hierachy, so we need another mechanism for all the hierachies the system finds. For classification:
    If a new item holds no title, then it can be considered the parent of the old item since the new item  just adds an item but time-wise it is a child,
    so the creation dates of things play a role. If something is newer then it will always be a child not a parent. A thing itself can only change in time,
    e.g. a blog post we change, it might even become a different type e.g. if we remove the title. So a thing can be a of a different type during time.
    But can only be one thing at a certain time.<br />
    Im thinking of a text file "language" in a folder things. This has only one property: parents. Which is a list of other things. And it
    has content which is typed inside this file. In that way I only need one folder "things" and a whole bunch of files. each file will
    only contain parents: and content:. Via that way probably the complete structure can be setup. It will be hard however to make
    a new posting, since you will have to enter each individual property and a long list of parent by hand in a seperate file.
    So it will need some "helpers" which are probably types.
