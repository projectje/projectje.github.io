<h1>The FOCUS budget - a better family budget</h1>
<h2>The budget</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Until you buy a house / family of your own / etc , life is cool, no need for complex things</li>
    <li>Then .. complexity starts and "no-time-for-anything-else" and you get "responsibility" and "husband-wife" discussions (or nowadays
        other sex combinations), mostly this is when the concept "budget" starts to make sense: it clears your mind because it gives you answers</li>
    <li>Then you get really old, you live of your money that you set set aside and then you die, having a funeral paid by the insurance you
        paid for years</li>
</ul>
<p>
    This will not change. Bummer.
</p>
<p>
What can be improved is old way of organizing a family budget. While it does do a good job to at least "have something", it
does not help greatly with decisions and only partly gives the insight that a family really needs.
</p>
<p>
This is where the FOCUS budget comes along: a really simple re-grouping of budget posts: instead of grouping your budget in "incoming money"
and "outgoing money", we split the budget in "things you need to discuss" and "things you do not need to discuss". A complete new paradigma
which will decrease the time you need to spend on "budget", while increasing the insight a lot. It means you will make better decisions, and
better decisions lead to a happier life.
</p>
<h2>Try it yourself</h2>
<p>
On the top level you divide your life, INSTEAD of "incoming money" and "outgoing money" in these 7 parts:
<ul>
    <li>A. Income</li>
    <li>B. Family</li>
    <li>C. Discussion</li>
    <li>D. No Discussion</li>
    <li>E. Your Stuff</li>
    <li>F. Your Relations</li>
    <li>G. Plan</li>
</ul>
<p>
:
</p>
<h3>A. Income</h3>
<p>
    Here you will only have  2 posts with the expected income. Since you know your salaries, this should be simple
    <ul>
        <li>your income</li>
        <li>the income of your partner</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        So here no "tax returns for paid rent mortgage", no "child support subsidy", just "your income".
        This is the place however to put your pension here if you receive a pension or wellfare or anything alike.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is a section you will never to look at again, unless you want to move up or start a side-business. An advantage of structuring this
        way is that you will much clearer see the impact of a side-business e.g. selling cats versus "doing away netflix": since there are
        2 ways to improve a budget. but if you mix it up, it becomes fuzzy. A family typically will move to "save money on gas or netflix"
        with a traditional budget. "A budget is keeping spending under control". But with this grouping, the mindset will change: "A budget
        gives me starting thoughts on how to increase income" (which is better).
    </p>
</p>
<h3>B. Family</h3>
<p>
    Here you will have 1 post per family member with an assigned budget
    <ul>
        <li>Dad</li>
        <li>Mum</li>
        <li>Kid 1</li>
        <li>Kid 2</li>
        <li>Kid 3</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        You can put here the "received child support subsidy for kid 1" (as a +) and the school costs, sport costs, daycare costs
        for kid 1 (as a "-"). This will tell you exactly over the years "how much does a kid cost" and will give you much more insight
        on the total budget for a kid than putting it simply in "income". You can make subposts for the things that are large chunks or
        you think that are important to keep track off e.g. "glasses once per 4 years divided over 4 years" or "barber".
    </p>
    <p>
        This is a non-discussion post. It is simple: you assign it and that is it. No need to discuss. You will find that the items
        you assign to family members in this section will move away "fuzzyness in your mind" because they are moved away from the
        thing you should be focussing on. In other words: it makes it clearer where you should focus on.
    </p>
</p>
<h3>C. Things to discuss / Yearly choice</h3>
<p>
    This section is the only section that is of importance. All the items you put here are the things that you have influence on
    and which directly have impact. By moving everything else way, this set is small and clear, making money discussions SMART and clear.<br />
    Once every year, somewhere at the end, you will have 1 (one) longer discussion on how you are going to divide your money for the next year.<br />
    It contains of 3 parts:
    <ul>
        <li>Subscriptions</li>
        <li>Pay Debts</li>
        <li>Leisure</li>
        <li>Savings</li>
        <li>Stuff</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <b>Subscriptions</b> are all the things you pay for regularly but where in theory you live without e.g. newspaper, netflix, X-Box Live,
        Internet Max 500 Gigbyte subscrption, TV All Channels, Library, Lottery's, charities, domain names, hosting, spotify, funeral-insurance,
        and so on. The total amount while amaze you.<br />
        <b>Pay Debts</b> here you put the amount of money you want to pay to a debtor (not the debt itself) e.g. if you want to pay back
          1000 euro extra on your mortgage this year, then here it goes<br />
        <b>Leisure</b> here you put the posts of the money you spend or earn with leisure time: vacation , days off, flowers, gifts,
          party's and possibly also you cat or dog.<br />
        <b>Saving</b> here you put all your savings accounts e.g. the money you put away for when your kid goes to university or your
          post for when sometimes in your house breaks down e.g. a car or a refrigerator</br>
        <b>Stuff</b> here you put the list of things that you want to buy this year for your house or around your house e.g. paint job,
          a new table or a large garden improvement
    </p>
    <p>
        Between these 5 topics you will divide that money that is left when you do A-B-D = C. Since A, B and D are "fixed": this is the
        amount of money where you can decided on to either save everything for later or just spend everything on one big party. Since everyone
        has a differnt viewpoint on "life and fun", this is where the discussion lies in a household e.g. my wife wants to have a far away vacation
        for 15.000 euro, because she works so hard the rest of the year, while I just want to sit in a garden for 0 euro and rather put the 15.000
        euro in savings acount or pay of morgage. And whil I do not care about Netflix at all, my kids will kill me if I would stop it. So I take
        my loss here. Note that you do not put "mobile phone subscriptions" in here, since these are in category B: they belong to the per person budget.
        Category C is only for items where the whole family benefits from. Not just 1 person.
    </p>
</p>
<h3>D. No Discssion needed</h3>
<p>
    In here you put all the things that you have no control of. They are useless to spend energy on debatting or worrying about. just put
    them here and once in a while check that nothing went way of expected. You are only in this section to move from one supplier to
    another supplier e.g. another energy supplier. Typically this will be closer to double the budget for #2.<br />
    Examples of what you put here:
    <ul>
        <li>Paypal/Mastercard/Bank Transactions - where you have no clue where to put it on since you dont know, this should be 0 but never is</li>
        <li>Groceries - split it in "take away" and "non take away" to know the balance for all those pizzas</li>
        <li>Mortgage - here you put the tax return for rent-paid (as +) and the rent and other mortgage costs  (as a -)</li>
        <li>Transportation - costs for bike, care (insurance, gas, taxes), public transporation, parking, car wash and such</li>
        <li>Groceries - all groceries other than food, this should be a small amount typically</li>
        <li>Living - costs for energy, gas, costs for house insurances, costs for taxes to the city, costs for water taxes and so on (as a -) but non mortgage tax returns as (+)</li>
        <li>Health care - costs for health insurance, dentist (as a -) but also the returns you get (as a +) </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h3>E. Stuff</h3>
<p>
    This category is not in your budget. <br />
    Keep it offline in a tool or spreadsheet or OneNote. Here you will make a list of your stuff and this is where you will keep
    important information, contact information, bills, manuals, SIM card codes, and so on. If you divide a bit smartly, it
    will give you after some time, a good view on your stuff and you will never have to look up stuff anymore. I have divided this
    in household devices, my home network and info, clothings (and sizes), software, electronics, lamps and lighting and so on.
    But I also put here recipes from my mother and when I need need to buy stuff e.g. weird battery for weird lamp, internet links
    on stuff I buy (or sell). <br />
    In time you can use this to get a managing replacements, how much money is in your stuff in total and for how much you need to insure it.
    But also is handy when you quickly need information and dont have to stress out searching a gazillion papers for a number.
</p>
<h3>F. Relations</h3>
<p>
    Here you keep a list of (important) persons. So your parents and their birthdays and marriage dates, the ones from friends and other
    family but also persons which are needed because you are now a parent: e.g. the telephone number of the local daycare or the
    school teacher's phone number: so that both you are your partner have always the latest emergency numbers in one place and
    with the gazillion fully planned weekends can check birthdays and addresses to drive to. An import from the phonebook from both
    your partner's phone and your own phone AND your kid's "class friends lists" is a good start. So when your kid is gone also
    you can call other mums to check if he or she is there.
</p>
<h3>G. PLAN</h3>
<p>
    The plan category contains the following single pages:
    <ul>
        <li>Long Term Plan - a sheet with per line 1 year and for every family member and the house, one column - in every year you note ages of family members and important events e.g. "2032 we are
            expected to go on retirement", when you start with your birth year it will give you a good high level overview of your life (and the lives
        you are now responsible for)</li>
        <li>TODO - a family todo list of items, takes aways the pain of repeating things a gazillion times. Create subpages for things that are too difficult to do at once e.g. research for which new TV im going to buy</li>
        <li>Emergency - a list of emergency phone numbers and things to do</li>
        <li>Rules - IF you have kids ... put bedtimes and other related things here (although you know it is useless at least you try)</li>
        <li>Agenda - we have a shared agenda using Outlook so we all have a good view on IF we can plan something on a certain weekend, since
            we all indepedently plan things, and it makes it much quicker to see if there is something free on a certain weekend.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h2>Life is under control</h2>
<p>
That's it. By moving your budget from an "incoming money" to "outgoing money" chore, you integrate it in your flow. And by leveraging on this
you will gain new insights. With these new insights your brain will get clearer and you will make better decisions and have your life under
better control By putting all discussion points in one section, you clear the rubbish and see only the things worth discussing. By grouping
both + and - per category you really see what the group costs or brings in.
</p>
<h2>Budget Tools that support the focus budget</h2>
<p>
There are countless budget tools. And in here we are open for suggestions for tools that support the Focus budget grouping of posts versus
the old "income" / "outcome" grouping.
