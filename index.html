<h1>Projects GitHub Pages Site</h1>

<p>
    Was on my todo list but today added a  page (<a href="https://pages.github.com/"> pages </a></a>)
    Instead of using a tool like <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> I think I will create something in PowerShell that will
    generate my static pages. Undoubtly someone has already made this but its probably only a few hours work (...) to do so.
    I think there will be something like posts. When I started blogging the concept of a headline did not exist, i think I will revert
    to this, since headlines became SEO and is way to pretentious. It will need some taxonomy (tags,categories, projects), a search system,
    a comment system, a way to store media, a way to handle links outdated, special sections for specific topics, etc... so in the end
    it might be more than a few hours work.

    Probably there are little pieces of content which have a type e.g. a post, page, bookmarks and so on, each of these have properties
    and the properties can be complex and custom. Each of these pieces of content can have a specific workflow attached, which is code.
    So I think each of these pieces of content is an object based on a class. So probably there needs to be folder class definitions first.
    Classes have their own taxonomy.<br />
    To import tens of thousands of wordpress posting (and before wordpress from the end 90's). Its probably handy to include the properties
    that WordPress exports in its backup XML file, so that a mass conversion is the easiest this will be:
    <ul>
        <li>item
            <ul>
                <li>title</li>
                <li>link</li>
                <li>pubDate</li>
                <li>dc:creator</li>
                <li>guid with indication if permalink</li>
                <li>description</li>
                <li>content:encoded which is a CDATA item</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>this contains relative and fixed paths so a conversion needs to run here</li>
                    <li>it would also be nice if a linkchecker removes any links that are outdated</li>
                    <li>some spellchecker would be very nice...</li>
                </ul>
                <li>expert: idem also encoded Cdata, in my case mostly empty</li>
                <li>wp:post_id might be handy to keep as reference</li>
                <li>wp:post_date might be handy to keep as reference</li>
                <li>wp:post_date_gmt idem</li>
                <li>wp:comment_status idem</li>
                <li>wp:ping_status idem but never used it</li>
                <li>wp:status idem</li>
                <li>wp:post_parent</li>
                <li>wp:menu_order</li>
                <li>wp:post_type</li>
                <li>wp_post_password probably useless in new system</li>
                <li>wp:is_sticky probably handy to convert to equal functionality</li>
                <li>category domain niceame cdata : will convert these but keep the old ones around for reference</li>
                <li>wp:postmeta consisting of wp:meta_key and wp_meta_value (CDATA) will convert these but keep old ones around for reference</li>

            </ul>
        </li>
        I think I have roughly 20.000 individual postings since 99, problem is that I sometimes posted things I dont agree with anymore, and also
        it contains a gazillion links that no longer exists or where there are now different sites. So I might in the end need to check them one by ones
        and add some annotation OR put some annotation above like "not re-reviewed yet disclaimer" or something alike.
    </ul>
