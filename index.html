<p>
Was on my todo list but today added a  page (<a href="https://pages.github.com/"> pages </a></a>)
Instead of using a tool like <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> I think I will create something in PowerShell that will
generate my static pages. Undoubtly someone has already made this but its probably only a few hours work (...) to do so.
I think there will be something like posts. When I started blogging the concept of a headline did not exist, i think I will revert
to this, since headlines became SEO and is way to pretentious. It will need some taxonomy (tags,categories, projects), a search system,
a comment system, a way to store media, a way to handle links outdated, special sections for specific topics, etc... so in the end
it might be more than a few hours work.
